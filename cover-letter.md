Hi! 

The opportunity to work with Kit is one that i'd actually hoped i'd have when Waddle initialy joined x15. 

The product's vision to improve financial capability in youth is one that I find inspiring, and the team that you've built appear to be passionate and talented. I have two younger boys of my own (a 4 year old and a 10 month old) and a sister who is actively trying to navigate this area with her own kids who are right in the middle of the target customer age range (i've been trying to get her to install Kit for months!). Selfishly, I'd love to be part of a team that are actively working to improve my family's life in a very real way.

My time at Waddle as it's grown and transformed over the years has been a wild ride, however the responsibilities, opportunities and experience that it's given me have been immense. I can see some potential overlap of that experience with what's being asked of the CTO role in Kit, and I would love to have a chance at seeing what we could to together. 

Thanks for considering me for this role.

Dan
