Hi! 

I am really excited to be able to apply for the CTO role at Kit. The opportunity to work with Kit in some capacity is one that i'd actually hoped i'd have when Waddle initialy joined x15. 

The product's vision to improve financial capability in youth is one that I find inspiring, and the team that you've built are evidently passionate and talented. I have two younger boys of my own (a 4 year old and a 10 month old) and a sister who is actively trying to navigate this area with her own kids who are right in the middle of the target customer age range (i've been trying to get her to install Kit for months!). Selfishly, I'd love to be part of a team that are actively working to improve my family's life in a very real way.

During my tenure at Waddle, I have been fortunate enough to be part of periods of growth and transformation, both personally and professionally. I have led teams through significant product developments, delivery challenges, uncertainty, acquisitions and strategic pivots, whilst always trying to focus on empowering the team through the princples of servant leadership. I can see some potential overlap of that experience with what's being asked of the CTO role in Kit, and I would love to have a chance at seeing what we could do together. 

Thanks for considering me for this role.

Dan
